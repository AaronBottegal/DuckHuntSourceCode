PPU "file" format:

PPU_ADDR H
	If 0x00, EOF.
PPU_ADDR L
SETTINGS [ISCC.CCCC]
	I=Increment +32 flag.
	S=Single block provided after to use for count, otherwise array of bytes matching count.
	C=Count, 0x01 to 0x3F value is as-is. 0x00 would be treated as 256 but also would break the code in Duck Hunt.
[SINGLE BYTE OR ARRAY OF BYTES MATCHING COUNT]
Repeat until EOF.
